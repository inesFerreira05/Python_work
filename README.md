# Python_work

Hello,

This is my work with Python.

I started with simple code, like the "Python_clock" and the "Currency_conversion" function.

Then I have done more complex work, like the "SpecialFrogGame" and "CatLifeGame" (in another repository).

Check it out and tell me what you think of that!
